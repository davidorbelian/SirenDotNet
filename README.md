SirenSharp
==========
SirenSharp is a framework of hard-coded classes and example code to implement the hypermedia format Siren by Kevin Swiber. Read more about the [Siren specification](https://github.com/kevinswiber/siren).

The media type for JSON Siren is `application/vnd.siren+json`.

The documentation, as is on the Siren Github page, is copy/pasted into the XML comments in the source code for easy reference while coding. The unedited version is in the `<remarks>` section.

Author considerations
--------
While the current state of this library isn't tied to any real world application just yet, it's the intension to introduce it into a (for now) secret project.

Like Siren, SirenSharp is still a work in progress and while implementing it into real world application changes will occur. Feel free to contribute. Thank you!
