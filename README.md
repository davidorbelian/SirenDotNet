SirenDotNet
==========
SirenDotNet is a framework of hard-coded classes and example code to implement the hypermedia format Siren by Kevin Swiber. Read more about the [Siren specification](https://github.com/kevinswiber/siren).

The media type for JSON Siren is `application/vnd.siren+json`.

The documentation, as is on the Siren Github page, is copy/pasted into the XML comments in the source code for easy reference while coding. The unedited version is in the `<remarks>` section.
